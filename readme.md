Ever get lost in a forgotten area known as Baldera? Well I've got the module for you! Baldera Map adds an electron-based minimap while you're in the Baldera area to help make it feel like it was meant to exist again. This is done by using the [TERA Toolbox](https://github.com/tera-toolbox/tera-toolbox) modding platform.

## Features

* Automatically opens when you're likely in Baldera, and automatically closes when you leave it.

* A moving dot showing a near real-time representation of your location on the map.

* Displays all routes, including smaller ones that you may not have known about.

* Moveable UI to be placed where you want it.

## Usage Notes
1. This may (or may not) work as expected on a display larger (or smaller) than 1920 x 1080.

2. You can use the command "balderamap" or "bmap" to open the map manually.
